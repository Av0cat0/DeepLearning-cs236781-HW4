    "- We'll set the `DataLoader`'s `batch_size` to `None` because we have already implemented custom batching in our dataset.\n",
    "- You can choose the number of worker processes generating data using the `num_workers` parameter in the hyperparams dict. Set `num_workers=0` to disable parallelization."
